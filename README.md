# yaleshuttle-imp
an improved version of the Yale Shuttle Application for CPSC419

## First-time Setup:

Navigate to the the main project folder in your terminal of choice. We also recommend that you create a virtual environment here.
You can then run one of the shell script packages below based on your operating system to install dependencies, set up database
files, and then run the application.

For Windows Users:
```
run_app.bat
```

For Mac and Linux Users:
```
./run_app.sh
```

The app will be available at the `/home` index: `your-ip-address:3000/home`.


## Regular Use

After your first-time setup, you can manually run:
```
start/b python data.py
```

And then run:
```
python app.py
```
